/// Prints the filename, function name, line number and textual representation of `object` and a newline character into the standard output if the build setting for "Active Complilation Conditions" (SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS) defines `DEBUG`.

/// The textual representation is obtained from the `object` using `String(reflecting:)` which works for _any_ type. To provide a custom format for the output make your object conform to `CustomDebugStringConvertible` and provide your format in the `debugDescription` parameter.
/// - Parameters:
///   - object: The object whose textual representation will be printed. If this is an expression, it is lazily evaluated.
///   - file: The name of the file, defaults to the current file without the ".swift" extension.
///   - function: The name of the function, defaults to the function within which the call is made.
///   - line: The line number, defaults to the line number within the file that the call is made.
